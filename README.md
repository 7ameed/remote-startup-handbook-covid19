## Founders guide

As a founder it's very scary to imagine how the entire team can collaborate completely remotely if you haven't done it before. 
It's not an easy task but it's acheivable, here is some tips for you.

1. Embrace the pros more than the cons.
   
   It's very important for your team to feel that you are onboard with idea of being work remotely. 
   
   This will give them the feeling that you trust them and gives them the sense of responsibility

2. Re-organize your goals & KPIs
   
   You have to rewrite your goals to be fit in short periods.

   You must be very sharp on what you need to accomplish. It needs to be specifically metered with numbers (KPI).

   Also it's very important to communicate that with your team. They must understand how their work contributes to company growth.

3. Your employees is your real capital, don't lose them.

4. Be transparent.
