## Founders guide

As a founder it's very scary to imagine how the entire team can collaborate completely remotely if you haven't done it before. 
It's not an easy task but it's acheivable, here is some tips for you.

1. Embrace the pros more than the cons.
   
It's very important for your team to feel that you are onboard with idea of being work remotely. 
This will give them the feeling that you trust them and gives them the sense of responsibility.


2. Re-organize your goals & KPIs.
   
You have to rewrite your goals to be fit in short periods.

You must be very sharp on what you need to accomplish. It needs to be specifically metered with numbers (KPI).

Also it's very important to communicate this numbers and KPIs with your team, they must understand how their work contributes to company growth.

3. Your employees is your real capital, don't lose them.

I know it's a hard time, You may have to cut your costs to extend your run way. The obvious choice will be layoff employees. Belive me that is the most terrible choice you will have to make.
First this will hurt your employees in this hard times, and make the remining employees feels insecure and feels betrayed by you. Their bond is much stronger that your bond with them.

> Stand for your employees not against them.

Instead you can cut your costs from other resources ( this is another topic for another article, let me know if you want more details on that )


4. Be transparent.

Transparency in this specific time is needed more than ever. Your team already knows that we are facing a hard time. So communicate with them, explain your plan and company situation. Ask for their help and they will respond, It's their company too.

## Team leaders guide

1. Communicate, communicate and communicate.

Communication is the key, You have to communicate regulary with your team ( at least 2 times a day ). This will keep you synk with your team, who's working on what.

It's depend on your methdology, but you can start the day with Standup meeting, and you can have 1:1 catchup call with your team and ending the day with quick recap.

> important note: Keep the meeting short (10-15 min) unless you have a good reason to make it long. 

Tools used: `Google Meet`, `Slack`


2. Understand the anatomy of working at home.

Working from home is boring, distracting. You have to understand that in order to give your team reasonable tasks to finish.

Prefect tasks is well written short stories

Don't calculate the working time as a bulk. No one will set for 6-8 hours straight even at the office. Instead define a time ( 1-2 hours) that all the team should be online together and the rest of the day make it flexible for them. 

Express to your team that it's ok if the kids sounds appear in the meetings. Don't push your team member to be angry ( Family always first ).

Tools used: none

3. More carrots, less stick.

It's very normal to see drop in the productivity, specially in the first weel or two. Please don't run and punish your team for that. 

Instead, try to award them for the good work. It's always paid off to show them how you apreciate their hard work.

Tools used: slack, phone, be creative.

4. Automate everything.

As said before, the productivity is dropped. and human errors will be much higher. So in order to maintain the quality of your product you must automate everything that can be automated.

Automate your code review: You can use tools like linters and services like Sonarqube and Shieldfy to automate the code review for you. This help you to identify problems fast and improve your workflow

Automate your deployment: If you don't have that yet, please do it fast. Make it Push to deploy for your test, development or staging environment. Allow developers to deploy their code without getting back to you.


Tools used: Github actions, Sonarqube, Shieldfy


5. Create developer handbook

Create a handbook and describe all the process of the development, QA and deployment.
Try to describe everything in steps. This allow developers to act fast without asking you about everything.

Tools used: Github, Markdown


## Developers guide

1. You are not at home, you are at work inside your home.

The first thing to do is to define a corner at your home and setup your disk, chair and PC. 

It's important to make it organized and looks like a professional desk like you have at work.

> Don't ever ever make your default work from bed or couch

Tell your family that you are at work and you need to focus. And reward them later with quality fun time with them, they deserve it.

2. Communicate, communicate and communicate.

Communicate with your team leader and your fellow developers on a regular basis.

3. Divide your time, but still be connected.

Don't imagine that you will spend 6-8 hours on your PC, this is home at the end. Instead be realistic and take a break with your family (ex: 15 min every 2-3 hours). 

But don't turn the notification off during this short breaks. Always be connected.
